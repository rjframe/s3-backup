s3backup is a collection of utilities to generate automatic cloud backups (scheduled via cron/Task Scheduler/launchd) through Amazon.com's AWS S3 service. The bucket / key naming system is such that multiple machines at multiple locations can be backed up, easily organized, and easily restored.

The suite has been tested on Linux (32-bit) and Windows 7 (64-bit w/ 64-bit Python).

AES encryption via pycrypto ensures all data is secure while off-site. Note: Version 0.5 begins using a hashed password for encryption, so it is incompatible with previous versions.

The file's hash is calculated for verification and incremental backups (to be implemented soon).
