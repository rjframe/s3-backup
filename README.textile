h2. s3backup

s3backup is a collection of utilities to generate automatic cloud backups (scheduled via cron).

It works well enough, but still lacks some features (notably full error handling, encryption).

All system configuration is in config.py - set your AWS access and secret key, directories, and a few settings.

The bucket / key naming system is such that multiple machines at multiple locations can be backed up and easily organized.

A restore tool does not yet exist - all restores must occur manually.
